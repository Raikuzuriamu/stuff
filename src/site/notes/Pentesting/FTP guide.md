FTP stands for file transfer protocol 

now for the main part ftp basically is a mean of transportation of files from and to web servers, it basically handles it , and it is exploitable but it depends


things you should do if you get access: look for all the files present and if any of  them seem like a good idea to download,  then download them and inspect them

In a nutshell
port:21
basic commands:-
get, put, cd . ls 

this is all I currently know, FTP can also have other exploits that lead to a lot of other things but I don't have experience with that yet
